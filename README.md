# Vision Impairment - The Australian Context 
*A Data Visualization Project for Accessibility*

This project is part of [Noisychart](https://data-visualisation.stem.melbourne/articles/noisycharts%20demo/datavisaccessibility), an initiative dedicated to developing accessible data visualizations for individuals with vision impairments. My role in the project focused on analyzing vision impairment trends in Australia and comparing them to global statistics using data analysis and visualization techniques. The visualization provides a gender-based breakdown of blindness and vision loss, offering insights for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers to identify disparities and improve eye health strategies.
The project is built on interactive data visualization principles, using R and Plotly to create an accessible and insightful representation of vision impairment prevalence.

## Objective
- **Bridges the accessibility gap** in traditional data visualizations by incorporating **high-contrast, interactive, and colorblind-friendly design**.
- **Enables data-driven decision-making** for **healthcare policy** by providing insights into **vision impairment trends over time**.
- **Showcases BI & Data Analytics skills** relevant to **public health analysis, dashboard development, and user accessibility**.

## Features
- **Data-Driven Insights** – Compares **Australia vs. Global vision impairment trends (2020)**  
- **Business Intelligence Approach** – Applies **data aggregation, visualization, and interactive dashboards**  
- **Accessible Design** – Uses **colorblind-friendly palettes, high contrast, tooltips, and alt-text for screen readers**  
- **Interactive Web Dashboard** – Published on **GitHub Pages** for public use  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Processed **Australian Bureau of Statistics** and **Health Metrics data**

## Dataset
The dataset used in this visualization originates from the Vision Loss Expert Group (VLEG) / Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2020 model, accessed via the IAPB Vision Atlas. This dataset provides a comprehensive, global and country-specific breakdown of vision impairment rates.

## Data Accessibility & Design Features
This visualization was built with accessibility in mind to ensure inclusivity for colorblind users, visually impaired audiences, and data analysts seeking clarity.
- **Clear Labels & Annotations**: Gender and region markers are clearly distinguished for easy interpretation.
- **Colorblind-Friendly Palette**: Uses Viridis color scheme to ensure readability for all vision types.
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Displays detailed data points for better analysis & screen reader support.
- **Alt Text for Visualizations**: Provides insightful summaries for visually impaired users.
- **High-Contrast Design**: Improves readability for users with low vision or light sensitivity.

## Key Insights
- Females experience higher vision impairment rates than males globally and in Australia.
- Age-related vision loss is increasing, especially presbyopia (near vision loss) due to an aging population.
- Northern Territory has the highest blindness rates in Australia, suggesting potential healthcare access issues.
- Vision impairment from uncorrected refractive errors is still a major global issue despite medical advancements.
